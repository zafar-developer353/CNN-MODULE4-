# CNN-MODULE4-
This project develops a CNN to classify digits from the SVHN dataset. Using data preprocessing and augmentation, the CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers is trained and tested. It achieves high accuracy, with results evaluated through a classification report, confusion matrix, and precision-recall curves.
